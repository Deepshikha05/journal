# Introduction to Data Warehouse

### Data Warehouse
 
 Data Warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support Business Intelligence [BI].

### Benefits of DW
 1. Subject-oriented: Can analyze data about a particular subject.
 2. Integrated: DW create consistency among different data types from different sources.
 3. Nonvolatile: Once the data has been ingested into DW, it does not change.
 4. Time-variant: DW analysis looks at change over time.


### Designing a DW 
While designing the DW, you must define the business requirement, scope and conceptual design. The next step is to create a logical and physical design for DW. The logical design involves relationships between objects and physical design involves the best way to store and retrieve objects, backup and recovery processes. One should focus on following while designing a DW.
- Specific data content.
- Relationships within and between data groups.
- System environment that will support data warehouse.
- Types of data transformation.
- Data refresh frequency.
