### Abbreviation explained
Regardless of ETL or ELT, the abbreviation can be explained like below.
- **E** - Extract or Extraction means fetching the data from the source or orginal database.
- **T** - Transform or Transformation means the process of changing structure of the data so that it integrated with the target data system or can be consumed by your stake holders. This can include joins with other tables, group by, column mapping, denormalizing, lookup on external database, machine learning modeling etc.
- **L** - Load or Loading means the process of depositing the information into a data storage system which can be a Data Warehouse [DW] or Data Lake.


### ETL vs ELT Overview
- ETL is the Extract, Transform, and Load process for data whereas ELT is Extract, Load, and Transform process for data.
- In ETL, data moves from the data source to staging into the DW.
- ELT leverages the DW to do basic transformations. There is no need for data staging layer.
- ETL can help with data privacy and compliance by cleaning sensitive and secure data even before loading into the DW.
- ETL can perform sophisticated data transformations and can be more cost-effective than ELT.

### What is ETL / ELT and why is it used?
ETL or ELT is used to make data pipelines, from fetching the data from the source to making the transformation that can help the end user to consume it directly or to storing into a data storage system like DW or Data Lake.

A simple example of ETL can be :
1. Fetching data using the API and dumping it into an s3 bucket
2. Loading the data into a staging table and making joins with other table and collating all the information that would be required by the end user.
3. Loading the final data into DW.
