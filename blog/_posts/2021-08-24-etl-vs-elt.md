# ETL vs ELT

In this post, we will understand ETL in detail and learn about the difference between ETL and ELT.

### Abbreviation explained
Regardless of ETL or ELT, the abbreviation can be explained like below.
- **E** - Extract or Extraction means fetching the data from the source or orginal database.
- **T** - Transform or Transformation means the process of changing structure of the data so that it integrated with the target data system or can be consumed by your stake holders. This can include joins with other tables, group by, column mapping, denormalizing, lookup on external database, machine learning modeling etc.
- **L** - Load or Loading means the process of depositing the information into a data storage system which can be a Data Warehouse [DW] or Data Lake.


### ETL vs ELT Overview
- ETL is the Extract, Transform, and Load process for data whereas ELT is Extract, Load, and Transform process for data.
- In ETL, data moves from the data source to staging into the DW.
- ELT leverages the DW to do basic transformations. There is no need for data staging layer.
- ETL can help with data privacy and compliance by cleaning sensitive and secure data even before loading into the DW.
- ETL can perform sophisticated data transformations and can be more cost-effective than ELT.

### What is ETL / ELT and why is it used?
ETL or ELT is used to make data pipelines, from fetching the data from the source to making the transformation that can help the end user to consume it directly or to storing into a data storage system like DW or Data Lake.

A simple example of ETL can be :
1. Fetching data using the API and dumping it into an s3 bucket
2. Loading the data into a staging table and making joins with other table and collating all the information that would be required by the end user.
3. Loading the final data into DW.

Online Analytical Processing [OLAP] DW need to work with relational SQL-based data structures. Therefore, any data you load into your OLAP DW must transform into a relational format before the data warehouse can ingest it. 

### ETL Advantages
- After transforming the data, ETL allows for speedier, more efficient, more stable data analysis. In contrast, ELT isn't ideal when the task requires speedy analysis.
- Often companies regulated by GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA need to remove, mask, or encrypt specific data fields [PII information] to protect the privacy of their clients. This could involve transforming emails to just the domain or removing the last part of an IP address. ETL provides a more secure way to perform these transformations because it transforms the data before putting it into the DW. At the same time, ELT requires you to put the data into the DW first which even after the transformations can be accessed through logs which violates GDPR compliance.


### ELT Advantages
- When it comes to data availability, ELT is the faster option. ELT allows for all of the data to go into the system immediately, and from there, users can determine the exact data they need to both transform and analyze. 
- Because the transformation step doesn't occur until after the data has entered the DW, it cuts down on the time it takes to load the data into its final location. There's no need to wait for the data to be cleansed or otherwise modified, and it only needs to go into the target system once.

### Conclusion
With data warehouse introducing powerful features like external tables, separation of storage and query engine, the lines between ETL and ELT have gotten blurred. In recent years ELT has been used to denote a process where raw data is loaded into a table (internal or external) and then some transformations are done on it to change it to a final format, which is the data used by the users. ELT has been gaining a lot of popularity, with powerful data warehouses offering a lot of flexibility, reduced cost(although this depends on how you use it), less engineering effort and with tools like DBT ELT has become a favorite among companies. Having said that there are lots of use cases for ETL, such as machine learning and accessing data that is not present in the data warehouse at transformation time.

If you are building a data pipeline it is recommended to start with the simplest solution which is an ELT pipeline, while making sure your data pipelines and code base is evolvable and then add ETL capabilities as needed. You might even end up doing 2 transformation steps such as running a ML model in one transformation step, loading the data into a data warehouse and doing more transformations within the data warehouse, thus becoming an ETLTL pipeline. As you can see this depends on your use case and project. The key idea is to start simple (think ELT) and add complexity (think extrenal transformation systems) as needed.

ELT is not recommended for applications OLTP databases. If you are working on loading data into an application’s OLTP database it is almost always recommended to use ETL approach, so as to not overload your application’s OLTP database and increase latency in your application.
